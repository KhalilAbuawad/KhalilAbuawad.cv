          This project help me further improve my overall frontend skills because I was responsible for large portions of the development which were at times very challenging and new, but also because I got to work with an experienced frontend developer.

          Results: Planners currently get a good overview of the schedule of their personnel. The web application have some potential improvements like better and faster data retrival and better frontend stack, preact might have been a poor choice in hinesight. This was probably caused by there being no project leader for this project, thereby not gaining a good scope of the project and at times poorly planned.
          Contribution: Shift week view, further develop the schedule view, increasing the view size, adding vacation/sick days, shift exchange between employes and more... 
          Frotend stack: <mark>Preact</mark><mark>PHP</mark>
          This was part of a larger project while still being large by itself. I mainly worked on this project as a frontend developer but were occasianlly involved in the backend, since our team were somewhat small (4) and varied. The main objective of this project was to give the planners a scheduling tool, but also have a great overview of the scheduling situation. This tool gives the planners the ability to plan the schedule for all the pilots, medics and pararescuers, much more.

            I was part of their frontend team in developing a new projec to help create a mobile application in react native. We were able to make a prototype within the time I was there and helped showcase it to investors.

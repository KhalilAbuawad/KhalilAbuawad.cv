          As the lead programmer of this project, I pushed myself to new heights of skill and expertise. I was responsible for the entire development process, from selecting the project stack to setting it up and implementing full-stack functionality. Initially, I worked on the project alone, but as it progressed, I assembled a team to support its continued growth and development. As the lead developer, I took on the responsibility of designing and developing the access system for the application. The goal was to ensure that users were granted appropriate access levels and provided with personalized web features based on their access rights.

          Latsamband is an innovative addition to the existing mobile application, Latsamband, utilized by NLA's workforce. This web-based platform offers employees a convenient alternative to completing tedious tasks on their mobile devices. It provides a comprehensive and efficient overview of their tasks and contributions, allowing them to add additional information when necessary. The application features a customizable dashboard, which displays pertinent information regarding their progress and status, including the ability to register new missions and modify existing ones, browse through missions with a personalized view, and register for courses. Furthermore, this application keeps employees on track and aids them in following through their workdays by providing notifications for current tasks.

          I acquired a deeper comprehension of Python programming after building a TCP/IP server from scratch. In addition, I gained insight into Docker and its potential to enhance a project's resilience by enabling it to self-configure and operate autonomously. The project also taught me more about data analytics for the purpose of data quality.

          The objective of this project is to transmit all current helicopter events, including positional data and other events, to a database. To achieve this, the project leverages TCP/IP to capture messages-over-IP originating from DZMx devices situated within the helicopters. By utilizing Docker, the project is automated and reinforced to ensure its smooth setup and operation.

          Client: Norwegian Air Ambulance AS

          Results: Very resiliant data fetching server with no maintance.

          Contribution: Store setup, stack setup, project setup, development setup, production setup, all components including: multiple landing pages, overview of missions registered, mission detail page, splitview option.

          This project was a way for me to improve my frontend skills because I was responsible for large portions of the development. I was new to the process and, it was challenging at times, however I was able to work with an experienced frontend developer who was able to guide me in growing my skills.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          The scheduling system was a significant part of a large project which I worked on as a frontend developer, occasionally helping out the backend team. The main objective of this project was to give the planners a scheduling tool and a way to get an overview of the situation. This tool provides the planners the ability to schedule assignments and responsibilities for professionals such as; pilots, medics and pararescue specialists.

          Client: Norwegian Air Ambulance Helicopter AS

          Results: Planners receive a good overview of the schedule of their personnel. They have access to a calendar that provides both detailed and big picture view of the schedule.  

          Contribution: Weekly shift view, further development of the schedule view e.g. increasing the view size, adding vacation and sick days, and shift exchange between employees.

            Working as part of the frontend team on a new project in Toronto was an incredible experience that pushed me to new heights of skill and expertise. It was thrilling to be immersed in the startup environment of the city, which has been called the "new Silicon Valley." The speed of the industry there was intense, and I loved every moment of it.

            Our project was to develop a mobile application in React Native that was tailored to the needs of people with disabilities, with a focus on assisting them in travel, much like Google Maps. Our approach relied on the community to mark and post information about obstacles, such as benches. I was fortunate enough to work alongside experienced developers, including an accomplished UX designer and a blind accessibility expert, which helped me to gain a deeper understanding of programming with accessibility, usability, and inclusion in mind.

            During my time there, we were working towards creating a MVP that we could showcase to potential investors. We were successful in our efforts, and we celebrated by going to a Kevin Hart live show! Overall, my experience in Toronto was unforgettable and taught me so much about the industry and the importance of designing with diversity and inclusion in mind.

          My study towards a Master's Degree ranged across a broad spectrum, taking upon a variety of subjects which directed me towards Gründerskolen. This then enabled me to attend a three month internship in Toronto in where I experienced the fast pace industry of startups. This experienced allowed me to develop both professionally and personally. Whilst taking my masters, I was intrigued by a subject called "Machine Learning and Renewable Energy" which inspired my master thesis: Machine Learning Prediction of Power Demand for Electrical Vehicle Charging Stations in Norway. Thorough research in my Master's degree taught me a lot about data processing and analysis within machine learning. Coming from a programming background I was not expecting machine learning to consist of so much data processing and analysis. I enjoyed programming and experimenting with different machine learning techniques in python.

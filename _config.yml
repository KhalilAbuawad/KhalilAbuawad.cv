          This project was a way for me to improve my frontend skills because I was responsible for large portions of the development. I was new to the process and, it was challenging at times, however I was able to work with an experienced frontend developer who was able to guide me in growing my skills.

          The scheduling system was a significant part of a large project which I worked on as a frontend developer, occasionally helping out the backend team. The main objective of this project was to give the planners a scheduling tool and a way to get an overview of the situation. This tool provides the planners the ability to schedule assignments and responsibilities for professionals such as; pilots, medics and pararescue specialists.
        
          Client: Norwegian Air Ambulance Helicopter AS
          
          Results: Planners receive a good overview of the schedule of their personnel. They have access to a calendar that provides both detailed and big picture view of the schedule.  
          
          Contribution: Weekly shift view, further development of the schedule view e.g. increasing the view size, adding vacation and sick days, and shift exchange between employees.

            I have been working on multiple projects and tasks for both inhouse and sister companies. I worked on a range of full stack tasks to data processing and retrieval to further develop new applications used by Norwegian Air Ambulance personnel.

            I was part of their frontend team in developing a new project to help create a mobile application in react native. The mobile application was to be directed towards people with disabilities to assist them in travel, much like Google Maps, but tailored to their needs. The application relies on the community to mark and post information about obstacles, such as benches. We were able to make a prototype within the time I was there and helped showcase it to investors. I gained a good understanding of programming with accessibility, usability and inclusion in mind.

          My study towards a Master's Degree ranged across a broad spectrum, taking upon a variety of subjects which directed me towards GrÃ¼nderskolen. This then enabled me to attend a three month internship in Toronto in where I experienced the fast pace industry of startups. This experienced allowed me to develop both professionally and personally. Whilst taking my masters, I was intrigued by a subject called "Machine Learning and Renewable Energy" which inspired my master thesis: Machine Learning Prediction of Power Demand for Electrical Vehicle Charging Stations in Norway. Thorough research in my Master's degree taught me a lot about data processing and analysis within machine learning. Coming from a programming background I was not expecting machine learning to consist of so much data processing and analysis. I enjoyed programming and experimenting with different machine learning techniques in python.

          The program includes theory and methods for programming both individual machines and machines in networks. One learns to create systems that are reliable, flexible, user-friendly and efficient. Practical solutions to problems are part of the education. One gains insight into the technology behind the computers, how the machine can be used to solve tasks and what challenges the information technology society gives us.
          IT is more than a tool for other subjects. As an computer scientist, we are an active driving force in social development. One works with basic issues that provide new insights and opportunities throughout society, by helping creating new applications.

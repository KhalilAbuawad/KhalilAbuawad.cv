          This project help me further improve my overall frontend skills because I was responsible for large portions of the development which were at times very challenging and new, but also because I got to work with an experienced frontend developer.

          This was part of a larger project, but still large by itself. I mainly worked on this project as a frontend developer but were occasianlly involved in the backend, since our team were somewhat small (4) and varied. The main objective of this project was to give the planners a scheduling tool, but also have a great overview of the scheduling situation. This tool gives the planners the ability to plan the schedule for all the pilots, medics and pararescuers, but also much more.
